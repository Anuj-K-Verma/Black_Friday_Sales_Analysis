## üìä Project Steps Overview

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Walkthrough of the Dataset
**Goal:** Load the dataset, inspect its structure, and understand the contents.  
**Actions:**  
- Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.  
- Check for missing values and discrepancies.  
- Use `df.info()` to inspect column types and non-null counts.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Analyzing Columns
**Goal:** Understand each column‚Äôs distribution and relevance.  
**Actions:**  
- Focus on key columns: `Gender`, `Age`, `Marital_Status`, `Product_Category`, `Purchase`.  
- Remove sparse columns (`Product_Category_2` & `Product_Category_3`).  
- Use `.unique()` and `.nunique()` to get unique values of columns.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Occupation & Products Analysis
**Goal:** Understand product preferences by occupation.  
**Actions:**  
- Analyzed `Occupation`, `Product_ID`, `Product_Category_1`.
